Like preachy vegans gettin' hate on the day of Eid
It was constantly raining maiming critiques, was afraid to speak
I needed an outlet to vent, I had to target my rage
Then a rap at a monstrous pace and they laughed
Only till I started gettin' paid (Ain't that funny now?)

First, I learned to pronounce every word
Then, I put together nouns and the verbs
And I learnt to speak by first sounding absurd
Before I went in search of the kind I deserve
Earned a fee from dirty beats
I was making by knocking on Qwerty keys
And my skills stayed profuse and mental
I made the blind see my true potential

It's a fact that I live to rap
I grind harder than molars in silverbacks
Now watch a lunatic go ape
Drive you crazy like Ubers with no brakes

So, you said I can't, you said I won't
But I did the impossible, for sure
When I made it look way too easy (Way too easy)
They said I can't, they said I won't
But I did the impossible, for sure
When I made it look way too easy (Way too easy)

I struggled and hustled to get the
(Spotlights on) My come up from under, but look, I'm
(Alright now) While you hatin' the fact that I'm gettin'
(All I want, all night long)

My methods could tutor a vet
With the musical heat that could fuel a jet
Labels saying my persona don't fit
The requirements of what the consumer expects
You little cubicle plebs
Your view is the proof that the future regrets
You're sewage at best, remove you from the scene
Like Angelina Jolie's tumorous breasts

I'm here to debunk your brain
Show the world why you punks are lame
You rappers, you claim that you run the game
But then open for me for a chunk of change
Got checks to prove that I ain't bragging, y'all
I'm just illusive like a damn padded bra
I'm gold in the gravel pit, the rap game's anarchist

I struggled and hustled to get the
(Spotlights on) My come up from under, but look, I'm
(Alright now) While you hatin' the fact that I'm gettin'
(All I want, all night long)
(All night long) I struggled and hustled to get the
(Spotlights on) My come up from under, but look, I'm
(Alright now) While you hatin' the fact that I'm gettin'
(All I want, all night long)

I remember being scared that I would grow up and be
In front of my idols, telling them how I feel so woeful and weak
That kids like me, wanna be like you but all we know is defeat
It don't matter how much you try
There are heights that we're never going to reach

I'm tired of it always seeming
Like what I deserve is beyond my dreams
But no matter where you come from
Y'all have what it takes to write your destiny and gamble with fate
So I take what is mine, stay in define
'Cause I'm cocky with a focused, steady mind
Better believe that it's alien science
The way I forever, just stay in my prime

I struggled and hustled to get the
(Spotlights on) My come up from under, but look, I'm
(Alright now) While you hatin' the fact that I'm gettin'
(All I want, all night long)
(All night long) I struggled and hustled to get the
(Spotlights on) My come up from under, but look, I'm
(Alright now) While you hatin' the fact that I'm gettin'
(All I want, all night long)

You said I can't, you said I won't
But I did the impossible, for sure
When I made it look way too easy (Way too easy)
They said I can't, they said I won't
But I did the impossible, for sure
When I made it look way too easy (Way too easy)
