Mic check, mic check
Yeah, the mic alright? 
Thanks a lot
Uh, yo
It's Brodha V
Some of you might 
have heard of me
I talk about money, 
I talk about rap music
I talk about getting high
But now, 
I'ma talk about God

Back in the time when 
I was lacking a dime
My hopeless youth had 
me slowly get attracted to crime
Then sat an alliance to 
talk it out with practical minds
Felt a force within me, 
get all my talents combined

Enacted a mime, enlightened, 
I decided to rhyme
Delighted and excited, 
I'm planning to rap 'til I'm prime
Started spilling ink on 
the paper and planned 
to get signed
But the world is biased, 
so wild, they got me 
slapped with a fine

Never got a chance, 
never let me spit on the mic
Only 'cause I come 
from a land where 
people ain't white
Day and night, 
I keep flowing, 
completing all my demo tracks
In spite being denied 
the right by anti-democrats

Unleash my rage 
through music intense
The cultural shock 
that got my whole community tensed
That's when I close 
my eyes and talk to God
Peace in my head, 
I'm singing this song, and it goes like

आत्मा रामा आनंद रमना
अच्युत केशव हरि नारायण
आत्मा रामा आनंद रमना
अच्युत केशव हरि नारायण

Life is an octopus tryna 
choke you with tentacles
Survived by only those 
who prove to be sensible
With only two choices, 
good and the bad, uh
The hardest part is to 
be choosing a path, check this

I could've got myself 
in dealing with drugs
Or maybe pop a weaker 
person dead while 
chilling with thugs
Maybe blow up my father's 
money spending on clothes
Fake an attitude for winning 
all them feminine votes, uh

One point of time, 
I got absorbed in foolish lies
Was juvenile, 
thought it was cool to get into brutal fights
I even had the thrilling urge to kill
The next second, 
the whole feeling reversed to guilt

I was offered a gun, 
that's when I dropped 
it for a mic
Took rap as a career 
and I thought that 
this was right
I close my eyes and 
give my thanks to God
Peace in my head, I
'm singing this song, 
and it goes like

आत्मा रामा आनंद रमना (that's right)
अच्युत केशव हरि नारायण (uh, uh, uh, take it and go)
आत्मा रामा आनंद रमना (that's right)
अच्युत केशव हरि नारायण

I'm being frank and 
I'm speaking my mind naked
Every day on my knees, 
praying to God that I make it
The only hope that keep 
me going is I know I'm artistic
To levels extreme, 
my haters agree I'm God-gifted

But that don't mean 
I lay around like clinical bait
When it's mayhem in my 
head at such subliminal rate
Cyclic monotony for me 
is cursed as debt
I'm only halfway through 
the phase between birth and death

One day, 
I wish to be like Eminem or 2Pac
And have a million people chanting, 
"Brodha V, you rock"
And maybe, 
wish to have a girl 
like Emma Watson
Or even accept a Grammy 
on stage while mama's watching

But 'til then, 
I'ma see days when 
the weather be rough
I better be tough, 
Brodha V gon' never give up
Now I'ma close my eyes 
and talk to God
Peace in my head, 
I'm singing this song, 
and it goes like

आत्मा रामा आनंद रमना (that's right)
अच्युत केशव हरि नारायण (uh, uh, uh, take it and go)
आत्मा रामा आनंद रमना (that's right)
अच्युत केशव हरि नारायण (uh, uh, uh)
